        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The CarCare+ mobile application is designed to help car owners manage
          the maintenance and servicing of their vehicles. It offers reminder
          features for basic tasks such as oil service times, tyre pressure
          monitoring, mileage tracking, inspection and tax payment due dates.
          The app also features a list of vehicle-focused products and
          additional features, such as scheduling service appointments, to help
          users keep their vehicles in top condition with minimal effort.

        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p>
          The main purpose of the CarCare+ application is to provide users with
          a convenient experience by meeting their vehicle's health and
          maintenance needs. In the application, the user aims to simplify the
          process by indicating important things such as vehicle mileage
          tracking, brake pad wear status, air filter status, maintenance
          reminders to the user. In addition, the application sends
          notifications to the user about vehicle inspection time, tax payments,
          traffic ticket inquiries. In addition, it is aimed to provide
          convenience to the user by displaying the vehicle-related products in
          the store section. As a result, our main goal is to increase the
          safety of the vehicle, ensure that the vehicle is used for a long
          time, and provide the user with a trouble-free management of the
          vehicle.
